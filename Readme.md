# Getting Started with hobbyCue  
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.  

## Available Scripts  
In the project directory, you can run:  

### `npm start`  
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

### `npm test`  
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  

### `npm run build`  
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
Optimizes performance, minifies files, and includes hashed filenames.  
Your app is ready for deployment!  

### `npm run eject`  
⚠️ **Warning:** This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.  
Copies all configuration files into your project for full control.  
Ejecting is optional and meant for advanced customization.  

## Troubleshooting  
If `npm run build` fails to minify, check the project configuration.
